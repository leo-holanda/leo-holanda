# Hi, I'm Leonardo!

I'm working as a web developer intern at NINC, graduating in Information Systems at UFAL and currently based in Maceió, AL, Brazil.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Working with
- TypeScript
- Angular
- Express and Node.js
- MongoDB.

### :mortar_board: Studying

- Ways to make my code better. Software design principles, clean code and best pratices are some things I'm into.
- English language, especially writing and speaking skills.

### Some facts about me

- :palm_tree: I love to spend time in nature and where I live this means some of the world's most beautiful beaches.
- :notes: Music is essential for me. [This](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0mA4liunPWnnlPCamzDe6r?si=0397e5acdeca4a85) is what I usually listen to.
- :open_book: I'm currently reading Anne Karenina by Leo Tolstoy and my favorite author is Carlos Ruiz Zafón. Reading is just awesome!
- :clapper: I really like cinema, especially Denis Villeneuve's movies.
- :video_game: Skyrim with mods is the best game I've played. Skyrim without mods is the second.

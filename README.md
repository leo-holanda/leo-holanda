# Hi, I'm Leonardo!

- I'm a software developer who graduated in Information Systems from the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL).
+ As an intern in web development at [NINC](https://github.com/ninc-management), I was part of a team that develops a business management software for engineering companies using MEAN stack and Socket.IO. 
- In my graduation thesis, I proposed and assessed a software that helps researchers conduct educational experiments in online learning environments. I was also part of a team at [NEES](https://github.com/nees-ufal) that developed this software using Vue.js and PHP/Laravel.
+ In my spare time, I develop open-source projects to learn and consolidate concepts and technologies while also aiming to solve real problems or just code something fun. Take a look at them in the pinned repositories below!

# Hi, I'm Leonardo!

- I'm a software developer who graduated in Information Systems from the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL).
+ As an intern in web development at [NINC](https://github.com/ninc-management), I was part of a team that develops a business management software for engineering companies using MEAN stack and Socket.IO. 
- In my graduation thesis, I proposed and assessed a software that helps researchers conduct educational experiments in online learning environments. I was also part of a team at [NEES](https://github.com/nees-ufal) that developed this software using Vue.js and PHP/Laravel.
+ In my spare time, I develop open-source projects to learn and consolidate concepts and technologies while also aiming to solve real problems or just code something fun. Take a look at them in the pinned repositories below!

EDIT 2024: Hi everyone! I want to let everyone who uses my projects know that I'm no longer able to dedicate time to maintain them in the near future. I'm completely focused on another career path that requires much time and effort. When I achieve my goal, I want to dedicate time again to address issues and try to improve the projects because this is something I do because I like it. I want y'all to know that I really appreciate the kind feedback and donations that I got from the projects. These are things that I remember fondly from some tough years that are now in the past. Thanks again and may God bless y'all!
